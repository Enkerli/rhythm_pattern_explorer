# Accent Morphing Failed Experiments Documentation

## Problem Statement
**Issue**: Accent positions morph/shift during live pattern changes in Serpe JUCE audio plugin
**Manifestation**: When switching between equivalent patterns (e.g., M:Alex ‚Üî M:Alexa, or different notations like `{[0,2,6,7]:11}110110111101110` vs `{[0,2,6,7]:11}M:Alex`), accent positions drift across cycles instead of maintaining synchronization
**User Requirement**: "Any time Enter is pressed, or the Tick mechanism is used, whether or not there's a new pattern, there should be a reset to step 0 for the rhythm pattern with an associated reset of the accent structure"
**Critical Constraint**: Must preserve polymeter behavior (no cycle boundary resets)

## Root Cause Hypotheses Tested

### Hypothesis 1: Pattern Change Detection Issues
**Theory**: Reset mechanism not triggering consistently on all pattern entry methods
**Test**: Modified `setUPIInput()` to trigger universal reset regardless of string comparison
**Result**: FAILED - Reset triggered but morphing persisted
**Evidence**: Debug logs showed reset occurring but subsequent accents still displaced

### Hypothesis 2: Timing Race Condition
**Theory**: `globalOnsetCounter` increments before reset takes effect due to audio thread timing
**Test**: Added `pendingPatternChange` flag to block counter increments during reset
**Result**: FAILED - Displacement continued despite blocked increments
**Evidence**: Debug logs showed increment blocking working but accents still wrong positions

### Hypothesis 3: Reset Counter Mechanism
**Theory**: Need separate counter for first accent calculation after pattern change
**Test**: Implemented `patternChangeResetCounter` to force position 0 usage
**Result**: FAILED - First accent correct (position 0) but subsequent accents displaced
**Evidence**: MIDI logs show F1 (accented) at first note as expected, but pattern shifts in later cycles

### Hypothesis 4: Flag Clearance Timing
**Theory**: `pendingPatternChange` and `patternChangeResetCounter` cleared at different times creating timing window
**Test**: Modified logic to clear both flags simultaneously after reset counter usage
**Result**: FAILED - Latest MIDI log still shows morphing patterns across cycles
**Evidence**: Current MIDI output shows inconsistent accent patterns between cycles

## Technical Approaches Attempted

### Attempt 1: Universal Reset Mechanism
```cpp
// In setUPIInput() - always reset regardless of pattern equivalence
globalOnsetCounter = 0;
uiAccentOffset = 0;
currentStep.store(0);
absoluteSamplePosition = 0;
activeNotes.clear();
```
**Outcome**: Triggered properly but didn't prevent morphing

### Attempt 2: Nuclear Reset Approach
```cpp
// Complete audio state clearing
globalOnsetCounter = 0;
uiAccentOffset = 0;
currentStep.store(0);
absoluteSamplePosition = 0;
activeNotes.clear();
patternEngineTransformationCount = 0;
// + reset all pattern state
```
**Outcome**: Eliminated some state but morphing persisted

### Attempt 3: Reset Counter with Delayed Flag Clearance
```cpp
// Use reset counter for first accent calculation
if (patternChangeResetCounter >= 0) {
    accentPosition = patternChangeResetCounter;
    patternChangeResetCounter = -1;
    // Keep pendingPatternChange active longer
} else {
    accentPosition = globalOnsetCounter;
}

// Later: clear pendingPatternChange after first audio cycle
if (!pendingPatternChange) {
    globalOnsetCounter++;
} else {
    pendingPatternChange = false; // Clear after blocking one increment
}
```
**Outcome**: Prevented early increments but displacement continued

### Attempt 4: Simultaneous Flag Clearance
```cpp
// Clear both flags together after reset counter used
if (patternChangeResetCounter >= 0) {
    accentPosition = patternChangeResetCounter;
    patternChangeResetCounter = -1;    // Disable reset counter
    pendingPatternChange = false;      // Allow increment again
}
```
**Outcome**: Clean flag management but morphing still occurs

## Evidence of Failure

### Latest MIDI Log Analysis (Post Final Fix)
```
1 1 1 4    Note 1 F1 127    <- First note correctly accented (position 0)
1 1 2 17   Note 1 C1 102    <- Pattern continues...
...
3 3 2 147  Note 1 F1 127    <- Accent pattern shifts
3 3 4 177  Note 1 F1 127    <- Two consecutive accented notes (shouldn't happen)
...
4 1 1 3    Note 1 C1 102    <- Pattern completely different from cycle 1
4 2 1 65   Note 1 F1 127    <- Accents at different positions
```

**Key Observation**: Accent patterns between cycles 1, 3, 4, and 5 show completely different structures, proving morphing is occurring despite all attempted fixes.

## Files Modified During Experiments

### Primary Changes
- `/Source/Platform/PluginProcessor.h`: Added `pendingPatternChange`, `forceAccentAtZero`, `patternChangeResetCounter` flags
- `/Source/Platform/PluginProcessor.cpp`: 
  - Lines 1320-1350: Universal reset in `setUPIInput()`
  - Lines 1025-1048: Reset counter accent calculation logic
  - Lines 1071-1087: Counter increment blocking and flag management
- `/Source/Core/UPIParser.cpp`: Fixed integer precision warnings with `static_cast<int>()`

### Debug Infrastructure
- Added comprehensive logging to `/tmp/serpe_accent_debug.log`
- Created test files: `/tmp/test_timing_fix.cpp`, `/tmp/test_reset_counter_timing.cpp`, `/tmp/test_polymeter_preservation.cpp`

## Preserved Features During Experiments
‚úÖ **Polymeter Behavior**: Successfully maintained different-length accent/rhythm patterns creating polymetric effects
‚úÖ **Pattern Equivalence**: Morse code conversions and binary notations working correctly
‚úÖ **Normal Playback**: Single pattern playback without changes works perfectly
‚úÖ **Universal Reset Triggering**: All pattern entry methods (Enter, Tick, MIDI, presets) trigger resets

## What Doesn't Work
‚ùå **Cross-Cycle Consistency**: Accent patterns shift between cycles of the same pattern
‚ùå **Pattern Change Synchronization**: Switching between equivalent patterns causes accent drift
‚ùå **Live Performance Stability**: Cannot reliably use pattern changes during live performance

## Technical Insights Gained

1. **Reset Mechanisms Work**: The reset logic correctly triggers and sets initial state to position 0
2. **First Accent Correct**: Immediately after pattern change, first accent calculation uses position 0 correctly
3. **Morphing Occurs Later**: The displacement/morphing happens in subsequent cycles, not immediately
4. **Audio Thread Timing**: All attempted timing fixes (blocking increments, flag management) did not resolve the core issue
5. **State Isolation**: The issue appears to be deeper than the variables we've been manipulating

## Failed Hypotheses Summary

1. ‚ùå Pattern change detection inconsistency
2. ‚ùå Audio thread timing race conditions  
3. ‚ùå Counter increment timing issues
4. ‚ùå Flag clearance synchronization problems
5. ‚ùå State variable contamination

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Commit Current Failed State**: Preserve all experimental code and debug infrastructure
2. **Revert to 640904a**: Clean slate for new approach
3. **Seek External Consultation**: The issue may require JUCE audio processing expertise
4. **Consider Alternative Architectures**: 
   - Complete separation of accent and rhythm counters
   - Event-based accent triggering instead of counter-based
   - Accent pattern pre-calculation and lookup tables
5. **Deeper Audio Processing Analysis**: May need to examine JUCE audio buffer processing, sample-accurate timing, or host DAW interaction

üî¨ EXPERIMENT: Failed accent morphing fixes - comprehensive documentation

Multiple approaches attempted to fix accent position morphing during pattern changes:

- Nuclear state clearing  
- Reset counter with timing controls
- Simultaneous flag clearance
- Audio thread synchronization

All approaches failed to prevent cross-cycle accent pattern drift.
Polymeter behavior preserved throughout experiments.
Ready for revert to 640904a and fresh architectural approach.
