# Manager Integration Notes

## Current State

The encapsulation experiment has successfully integrated three manager classes:
- `SceneManager` - Scene cycling functionality
- `ProgressiveManager` - Progressive transformation functionality  
- `AccentManager` - Accent pattern functionality

## Temporary Build Setup

Currently using temporary includes in `PluginProcessor.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "SceneManager.cpp"  // TODO: Add to Xcode project properly
#include "ProgressiveManager.cpp"  // TODO: Add to Xcode project properly  
#include "AccentManager.cpp"  // TODO: Add to Xcode project properly
```

## Proper Xcode Integration Steps

To properly add these files to the Xcode project instead of using temporary includes:

### Method 1: Using Xcode GUI (Recommended)
1. Open `Plugin/Builds/MacOSX/Rhythm Pattern Explorer.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Right-click on the source group in the navigator
3. Choose "Add Files to 'Rhythm Pattern Explorer'"
4. Navigate to `Plugin/Source/` and select:
   - `SceneManager.cpp`
   - `ProgressiveManager.cpp` 
   - `AccentManager.cpp`
5. Ensure "Add to target" includes both AU and Shared Code targets
6. Remove the temporary `#include` statements from `PluginProcessor.cpp`
7. Build and test

### Method 2: Manual project.pbxproj Editing (Advanced)
If GUI method isn't available, would need to:
1. Generate new GUIDs for each .cpp file
2. Add PBXFileReference entries
3. Add PBXBuildFile entries
4. Add to source build phases
5. Update group structures

### Current Working Status
✅ All managers build successfully with temporary includes
✅ Plugin installs and loads correctly
✅ Fallback mechanisms provide safety during transition
✅ Encapsulation experiment successful

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each manager handles one specific domain
2. **Testability**: Each manager can be unit tested independently
3. **Maintainability**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Safety**: Fallback mechanisms prevent total functionality loss
5. **Incremental Migration**: Legacy code remains functional during transition

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add managers to Xcode project properly (remove temporary includes)
- [ ] Continue encapsulation of remaining components
- [ ] Fix any existing functional issues (accent system UI/MIDI sync)
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for each manager
