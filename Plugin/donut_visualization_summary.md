# Rhythm Pattern Explorer v0.03 - Donut Visualization

## 🍩 New Animated Donut/Pie Chart Visualization

The plugin now features a sophisticated donut/pie chart visualization similar to the webapp, with these key features:

### ✨ Visual Features
- **Donut Shape**: Inner radius creates clean donut hole (40% of outer radius)
- **Pie Slices**: Each step is represented as a distinct pie slice
- **Slice Separators**: Clear dividing lines between each step slice
- **Step Numbers**: Large, bold numbered markers (0-based indexing)
- **Bigger Step Markers**: 16pt bold font for better visibility

### 🎨 Color Coding
- **Onset Steps**: Green slices (`#48bb78`) for rhythm hits
- **Rest Steps**: Dark gray slices (`#2d3748`) for silence
- **Current Step (Playing)**: Bright highlight colors:
  - Bright green (`#00ff00`) for onset steps
  - Light green (`#88ff88`) for rest steps
- **Step Numbers**: 
  - Black text on highlighted current step
  - White text on all other steps

### 🎵 Animation Features
- **Real-time Playback Tracking**: Current step highlights during playback
- **Smooth Animation**: Updates at 100ms intervals for fluid motion
- **Play State Awareness**: Only highlights during actual playback
- **Step Change Detection**: Immediate visual feedback on step transitions

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
- **Playback Integration**: Uses `getCurrentStep()` and `isCurrentlyPlaying()` from processor
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only repaints when step changes or play state changes
- **Responsive Design**: Scales with plugin window size
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal CPU usage during animation

### 📐 Layout
- **Outer Radius**: 35% of available space
- **Inner Radius**: 40% of outer radius (donut hole)
- **Step Numbers**: Positioned at middle radius between inner and outer
- **Slice Angles**: Evenly distributed based on pattern length

### 🎯 User Experience
- **Visual Clarity**: Easy to see current playback position
- **Pattern Understanding**: Clear visualization of rhythm structure
- **Step Identification**: Numbered steps for precise reference
- **Professional Appearance**: Matches webapp aesthetic
