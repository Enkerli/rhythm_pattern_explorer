# Rhythm Pattern Explorer v0.03 - Corrected Pie Visualization

## üîß Bug Fixes Applied

Based on your feedback, I've corrected the major issues with the pie chart visualization:

### ‚úÖ **Fixed Slice Positioning and Coloring**
- **Problem**: Strange offset between slice positioning and coloring (slice 0 only 1/6 filled, slice 1 mostly filled when should be empty)
- **Solution**: 
  - Draw background circle first with consistent dark color
  - Each slice now correctly matches its pattern position
  - Removed the confusing separate coloring logic

### ‚úÖ **Proper Step Markers Outside Pie**
- **Problem**: Numbers were hard to read inside slices
- **Solution**: 
  - Step markers now positioned OUTSIDE the pie chart (`markerRadius = maxRadius * 1.15f`)
  - Larger circular markers (16px diameter) with clear white numbers
  - Much more readable and matches webapp design

### ‚úÖ **Working Playback Highlighting**
- **Problem**: No visible current step highlighting during playback
- **Solution**: 
  - Bright orange highlight (`#ff6b35`) drawn OVER the existing slices
  - Only shows during actual playback (`isPlaying && currentStep`)
  - Clear visual feedback for current playback position

### ‚úÖ **Complete Dividing Lines**
- **Problem**: Missing dividing lines between slices
- **Solution**: 
  - All separator lines now drawn AFTER slice filling
  - Every step boundary has a clear dividing line
  - Consistent line thickness and color

### ‚úÖ **More Pie-like Design**
- **Problem**: Donut hole was too large and unnecessary
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced inner radius to 15% (from 40%) of outer radius
  - Just enough to avoid moir√© effects
  - More pie-like appearance as requested

## üé® **New Visual Design**

### Colors:
- **Onset slices**: Green (#48bb78)
- **Rest slices**: Dark gray background (#2d3748) 
- **Current playing slice**: Bright orange highlight (#ff6b35)
- **Step markers**: Dark gray circles with white numbers
- **Dividing lines**: Medium gray (#4a5568)

### Layout:
- **Pie chart**: 35% of available space
- **Inner hole**: 15% of outer radius (minimal)
- **Step markers**: 15% outside the pie circumference
- **Marker size**: 16px diameter circles with 12pt bold numbers

## üîç **Pattern Testing**

Now when you test with patterns like "101":
- **Slice 0**: Green (onset) - correctly filled
- **Slice 1**: Dark gray (rest) - correctly empty appearance  
- **Slice 2**: Green (onset) - correctly filled
- **All dividing lines**: Present and visible
- **Current step**: Bright orange highlight during playback

## üéØ **Webapp Compatibility**

The visualization now more closely matches the webapp design:
- Step markers positioned outside the pie slices for readability
- Clear slice boundaries with dividing lines
- Prominent playback highlighting
- Proper slice-to-pattern correspondence
- More pie-like appearance with minimal center hole

You should now see correct slice coloring, readable step markers, visible playback highlighting, and complete dividing lines!
