This is a classic timing issue in step sequencer plugins, especially when running as a MIDI effect in a DAW. The problem is that **notes after the downbeat are being triggered slightly early**—in other words, the sequencer is running a little ahead of the DAW's timeline after the first step.

### Why This Happens

From your code and the log, the likely cause is that the sequencer is **triggering the first step at sample 0 of the buffer**, and then advancing steps based on a fixed number of samples per step (`samplesPerStep`). If the DAW's playback doesn't start exactly at a step boundary, or if the buffer boundaries don't align with step boundaries, this can cause the sequencer to "drift" ahead, especially after the downbeat.

### Key Code Area

The critical section is in `processBlock` and `processStep`:

```cpp
while (currentSample >= samplesPerStep && samplesPerStep > 0)
{
    // Always trigger MIDI notes at sample position 0 for perfect timing
    processStep(midiMessages, 0);
    currentSample -= samplesPerStep;
    int newStep = (currentStep.load() + 1) % patternEngine.getStepCount();
    // ...
}
```

This triggers every step at sample 0 of the buffer, regardless of where the step should actually fall within the buffer.

## **How to Fix This**

### 1. **Calculate the Exact Sample Offset for Each Step**

Instead of always triggering at sample 0, you should:
- Track the **absolute sample position** within the timeline.
- For each buffer, calculate where each step should fall within the buffer.
- Trigger the note at the correct sample offset within the buffer.

### 2. **Implementation Outline**

- Maintain a variable for the **absolute sample position** (e.g., `int64_t absoluteSamplePos`).
- For each buffer, loop through the samples, and when `absoluteSamplePos` crosses a step boundary, trigger the note at the correct offset.

### 3. **Example Fix**

Here’s a conceptual fix for your `processBlock` loop:

````cpp
// ...existing code...
void RhythmPatternExplorerAudioProcessor::processBlock(juce::AudioBuffer<float>& buffer, juce::MidiBuffer& midiMessages)
{
    // ...existing code...
    int numSamples = buffer.getNumSamples();
    for (int sample = 0; sample < numSamples; ++sample)
    {
        // Check if it's time to trigger a step
        if (currentSample >= samplesPerStep)
        {
            // Calculate the exact sample offset for the step
            int sampleOffset = sample - (currentSample - samplesPerStep);
            if (sampleOffset < 0) sampleOffset = 0; // Safety

            processStep(midiMessages, sampleOffset);

            currentSample -= samplesPerStep;
            int newStep = (currentStep.load() + 1) % patternEngine.getStepCount();
            currentStep.store(newStep);
        }
        currentSample++;
    }
    // ...existing code...
}
````

**Key points:**
- `currentSample` accumulates across buffers.
- When `currentSample >= samplesPerStep`, you trigger a step at the **precise offset** within the buffer.
- This ensures that steps are always aligned with the DAW's timeline, regardless of buffer size or start position.

### 4. **Sync to Host Position on Playback Start**

When playback starts, **sync your sequencer's step and sample position to the DAW's transport position** (e.g., using `ppqPosition`). This ensures the first step is always aligned with the DAW's downbeat.

## **Summary Table**

| Problem                  | Solution                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Steps hit early          | Trigger at correct sample offset in buffer    |
| Drift after downbeat     | Sync to host transport on playback start      |
| Buffer size mismatch     | Use absolute sample position, not buffer 0    |

---

## **Final Advice**

- **Never trigger all steps at sample 0** of the buffer.
- **Always calculate the correct sample offset** for each step within the buffer.
- **Sync to host transport** on playback start or when the playhead jumps.
