To robustly match the visual accent markers with the actual MIDI accents, you need to ensure that both the audio (MIDI) and the UI (visual) code use **the same logic and state** for accent progression, especially when patterns or accent structures change.

### Key Observations

- **Audio (MIDI) Accent Logic:**  
  In `processStep`, the accent is determined by:
  - Using `globalAccentPosition` as a counter that increments **only when a step with an onset is played**.
  - The accent is:  
    `shouldAccent = currentAccentPattern[globalAccentPosition % currentAccentPattern.size()]`
  - `globalAccentPosition` is incremented **only when a MIDI note is triggered** (i.e., when the step is an onset).

- **Visual Accent Logic:**  
  In `drawPatternCircle`, the accent is determined by:
  - Calculating the number of onsets up to the current step (`onsetIndex`).
  - Using `globalAccentPosition` and `onsetsInPattern` to compute the accent cycle and offset.
  - The accent is:  
    `accentStep = (displayAccentOffset + onsetIndex) % accentPattern.size()`
  - This logic **tries to simulate** what the audio code does, but it can get out of sync, especially when patterns change, or if the number of onsets and accent pattern length don't align.

### Why Mismatches Occur

- **State Drift:**  
  The UI tries to reconstruct accent state from pattern data and `globalAccentPosition`, but this can diverge from the audio state, especially after pattern changes or when the accent pattern length doesn't match the number of onsets.
- **Pattern Change Timing:**  
  If a new pattern is loaded at the end of a cycle, the `globalAccentPosition` may not align with the new pattern's onsets or accent structure, causing a visual/audio mismatch.
- **Different Counting Methods:**  
  The audio code increments `globalAccentPosition` only on onsets, while the UI code tries to infer accent position for each step, which can lead to off-by-one or cycle mismatches.

## How to Adapt the Code for Robust Matching

**1. Use a Shared Accent State for Both Audio and UI**

- **Expose the actual accent index used for the last triggered MIDI note** (e.g., `lastAccentStep` or `lastAccentIndex`) from the processor.
- **Store a per-step accent flag** for the current pattern cycle, updated in the audio thread, and make it available to the UI for drawing.

**2. Synchronize Accent Progression**

- **Reset `globalAccentPosition`** in both audio and UI whenever a new pattern or accent structure is loaded.
- **Ensure the UI queries the accent state from the processor** for the current step, rather than reconstructing it.

**3. Provide a Mapping Function**

- In the processor, provide a function like:
  ```cpp
  bool isStepAccented(int stepIndex);
  ```
  This function would use the same logic as the MIDI accent trigger, ensuring the UI always displays the correct accent for each step.

**4. Handle Pattern Changes Carefully**

- When a pattern changes, **reset both the accent position and any cached accent state** in both audio and UI.
- Optionally, **broadcast a change notification** so the UI can update immediately.

### Example Adaptation (Conceptual, Not Code)

- **In the processor:**
  - Track and expose the accent index used for each step.
  - Provide a method for the UI to query: "Is this step accented in the current cycle?"

- **In the UI:**
  - Instead of reconstructing accent logic, **ask the processor for each step's accent state**.
  - On pattern change, **reset any local accent state** and re-query the processor.

## Summary Table

| Problem Area         | Current Approach                | Robust Approach                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Accent progression   | UI reconstructs from pattern    | UI queries processor for accent state  |
| Pattern changes      | UI tries to infer new state     | UI resets and syncs with processor     |
| Accent index logic   | UI uses math, may drift         | Processor exposes actual accent index  |

## Next Steps

- **Refactor the UI to use accent state from the processor, not local calculations.**
- **Ensure accent position is reset and synchronized on pattern changes.**
- **Optionally, cache per-cycle accent flags in the processor for fast UI access.**

---

**In summary:**  
To guarantee robust matching, the UI must not try to reconstruct accent logic independently. Instead, it should always use the accent state as determined by the audio processor, which is the source of truth for accent progression. This eliminates drift and ensures visual and MIDI accents are always in sync, even across pattern changes and complex accent structures.
