# Missing App Target Issue

## Problem Diagnosis ‚ö†Ô∏è

Your schemes show:
- `Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad - All` (static library)
- `Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad - Shared Code` (static library) 
- `Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad - AUv3.appextension` (extension only)

**Missing:** A proper iOS App target to contain the AUv3 extension.

## Root Cause

The .jucer file generated a project missing the container app. AUv3 extensions need a host app to be installed.

## Solution Options

### **Option 1: Fix .jucer File (Recommended)**

The issue is likely in the .jucer configuration. Let me check what's missing:

1. **Open** `RhythmPatternExplorer_iPad_FINAL.jucer` in Projucer
2. **Check iOS exporter settings**:
   - Look for "iOS Exporter" 
   - Make sure it has proper app settings
3. **Regenerate project**: "Save and open in IDE"

### **Option 2: Add App Target Manually**

If Projucer keeps failing:

1. **In Xcode**: File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Target
2. **iOS** ‚Üí **App**
3. **Settings**:
   - Product Name: `Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad`
   - Bundle ID: `com.enkerli.rhythmpatternexploreripad`
   - Language: Objective-C
4. **Embed AUv3 Extension**: 
   - Select app target ‚Üí General ‚Üí Frameworks and Embedded Content
   - Add the AUv3 extension

### **Option 3: Copy from Working Desktop Project**

Since your desktop project has working iOS targets:

1. **Open desktop project**: `Plugin/Builds/iOS/Rhythm Pattern Explorer.xcodeproj`
2. **Check what targets it has** (probably has proper app + extension)
3. **Copy the app target** configuration to our iPad project

## Quick Diagnostic

**Can you tell me:**
1. **In Xcode Navigator**, what do you see under "TARGETS" when you click the project?
2. **Are there any .app files** in the build products?
3. **In Projucer**, when you open the .jucer file, what does the iOS exporter section show?

Let's figure out which approach will work best for your setup! üéØ
