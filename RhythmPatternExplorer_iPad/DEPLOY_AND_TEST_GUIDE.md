# Deploy and Test on iPad - SUCCESS! 🎉

## Build Succeeded! ✅

Great work! Now let's get it running on your iPad and test it in AUM.

## Step 1: Deploy to iPad

### **In Xcode:**
1. **Connect your iPad** to your Mac via cable
2. **Select your iPad** as the target device (top toolbar in Xcode)
3. **Select the main app target** (not the AUv3 extension)
4. **Product → Run** (⌘+R)

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ App installs on iPad
- ✅ App launches automatically
- ✅ Shows simple UI with "Send MIDI Note (C4)" button
- ✅ AUv3 extension is registered with iOS

## Step 2: Test the Container App

### **On iPad:**
1. **App should open** and show your minimal UI
2. **Tap "Send MIDI Note" button**
3. **Status should change** to "MIDI Note Sent!"
4. *Note: You won't hear audio yet - this is just testing the container app*

## Step 3: Find Plugin in AUM

### **Install AUM (if not already installed):**
- Download **AUM** from App Store (by Kymatica)
- Or use **Logic Pro for iPad** if you have it

### **In AUM:**
1. **Create new session**
2. **Tap "+" to add new module**
3. **Look under "MIDI Effects"** section
4. **Find "Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad"** 
   - Manufacturer: "Enkerli"
   - Should appear with your plugin icon

### **Expected Location in AUM:**
```
Audio Modules
├── Instruments
├── Effects  
├── MIDI Effects  ← Look here!
│   └── Enkerli
│       └── Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad  ← Should be here!
└── Utilities
```

## Step 4: Load and Test Plugin

### **In AUM:**
1. **Tap your plugin** to add it
2. **Plugin UI should open** showing the same interface
3. **Tap "Send MIDI Note" button**
4. **Connect to a synth** to hear the MIDI note

### **Basic MIDI Test Setup in AUM:**
1. **Add your plugin** as MIDI Effect
2. **Add a synth** (like AUSampler or any iOS synth)
3. **Connect**: Plugin MIDI Out → Synth MIDI In
4. **Tap plugin button** → Should trigger synth

## Step 5: Verification Checklist

- [ ] App installs and runs on iPad
- [ ] Container app shows UI correctly
- [ ] Button tap changes status message
- [ ] Plugin appears in AUM under MIDI Effects
- [ ] Plugin can be loaded in AUM
- [ ] Plugin UI opens in AUM
- [ ] MIDI note sending works (triggers connected synth)

## Troubleshooting

### **Plugin not appearing in AUM:**
- Force-quit and restart AUM
- Restart iPad (to refresh AU component cache)
- Check that app installed successfully

### **Plugin crashes when loading:**
- Check Xcode console for error messages
- Verify both app and extension targets built successfully

### **UI doesn't respond:**
- Normal for first loading - AUv3 can take a moment to initialize
- Try tapping button again after a few seconds

## Success Indicators

**✅ Complete Success:** 
- Plugin appears in AUM
- Plugin loads without crashing
- Button sends MIDI notes that trigger connected instruments

**🎯 Next Steps After Success:**
- Test in other hosts (Logic Pro for iPad, GarageBand)
- Begin porting more features from desktop version
- Add touch-optimized controls
