# Simple Fix: Regenerate Project

## The Issue
Your project is missing the iOS app target - it only has the extension. This is a common JUCE iOS generation issue.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### **1. Clean and Regenerate:**
1. **Close Xcode completely**
2. **Delete the iOS build directory**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /Users/alex/Documents/Coding/rhythm_pattern_explorer/RhythmPatternExplorer_iPad/Builds/iOS
   ```
3. **Open Projucer**
4. **Open** `RhythmPatternExplorer_iPad_FINAL.jucer`
5. **Click "Save and open in IDE"** again

### **2. Check for App Target:**
After regeneration, you should see:
- âœ… **Rhythm Pattern Explorer iPad** (app target)
- âœ… **AUv3** (extension target)

### **3. If Still Missing App Target:**
Try this in Projucer:
1. **Go to iOS exporter settings**
2. **Look for "iOS Standalone App" or similar setting**
3. **Make sure it's enabled**
4. **Save and regenerate**

### **4. Alternative: Manual Fix**
If Projucer keeps failing, I can help you add the app target manually in Xcode.

## Try This First:
**Delete the Builds/iOS directory and regenerate from Projucer.** Sometimes JUCE iOS generation is finicky and a fresh generation fixes it.
