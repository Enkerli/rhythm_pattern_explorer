## Project Configuration
- **Plugin Installation**: Install to user library (`~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/`) NOT system library (`/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/`)
- **NO STANDALONE APP**: User explicitly does NOT want a standalone application - plugins only (AU/VST3)
  - Remove any `.app` files that get built accidentally
  - Focus on plugin formats only: AU Component and VST3
- **Licensing**: CC0 1.0 Universal (public domain)
- **JUCE Version**: 8.0.8 with WebBrowserComponent support

## Project Development Guidelines
- Before getting "carried away", make sure that was requested fully works as expected.
